        This beautiful rainbow colored graph tells us a frustrating story of everyday travel. Thousands of hours wasted, just because planes get delayed. 
        What if you could avoid these delays and save alot of time? As we can see from the graph, on a typical day we lose about 5000hours to delays. 
        If you were to work at $15/h job for that amount of time, you would make $75 000. That's more than most peoples yearly salary. What if we could optimize our travel and reduce the hours lost to delays in half? Wouldn't that be a win/win situation for all of us?

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>To begin analysing the data we do clustering to label the data a bit. Plot's x-axis is distance (km) and y-axis is arrival delay (min). From the elbow method using distortion and inertia we set the k-means model by giving it the number of clusters 4 as a hyperparameter because on value 4 the line starts going linear. From the cluster plot we see that clusters' centers are placed in low values of y-axis and there are more flights with short and medium distances.</p>

      <h3><b>Linear model</b></h3>
      <h5>Masi <span class="w3-opacity">Pallopää</span></h5>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>On this linear regression model we are explaining arrive delay (min) with two variables: departure delay (min) and distance (km). It is selfexplanotary that if plane leaves late it will probably arrive late. It can be seen too in this model because departure delay's coefficient is 1.01. So if plane departures one minute late it arrives one minute late also meaning it will departure:arrive 1:1 by minutes.</p>
      
<p>Null hypothesis is that the distance and dep delay do not have relationship between arr delay. From summary we see that p-value for both departure delay and distance is 0, meaning we can reject the null hypothesis on significance level of 0.05. We conclude that distance and dep delay do have relationship between arr delay. The effect of distance is negative so from distance's coefficient , -0.0013, we see that further the plane flies the less it will arrive late. Altough the distance has a huge standard error , 3e-05, so our predictions of distance's effect to the arrive delay may not be accurate. </p>
<p>R^2 and F-statistic both have large values indicating the model fits well to the data. It is mainly because dep delay and arr delay have such strong relationship.  By looking at the qq-plot we can conclude that the linear model is not suitable for this data as it should form a straight line, at least in the middle of the qq-plot. Therefore the conclusions from the model are inaccurate, statistically speaking.

      <h3><b>Logistic model</b></h3>
      <h5>Masi <span class="w3-opacity">Pallopää</span></h5>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>On this logistic regression model we are explaining arrive delay over 15 minutes with two variables: day of week and distance (km). If the plane arrives 15 minutes or more late to its destination it gets the value 1, else 0. Day of week is categorical factor and gets values from 1 to 7. </p>
<p>On significance level of 0.05 we can accept the null hypothesis of day of week but reject the distance. This means that on this model day of week has no effect on flights arriving late but distance has tiny amount of effect. Anyway both effects would be unnoticable because coefficient of day of week 0.002 is and distance's is 7e-05.</p>
<p>On this logistic regression model we notice the same thing that in the linear model: the model does not fit well. Logistic regression model's deviance is large, 7e+05, meaning the the model is not suitable for this data. Smaller the deviance, better fit for the model. All in all the conclusions from this logistic regression model are not very accurate.

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>We evaluated a random forest algorithm on this dataset's first 10 000 datapoints. It classified data by distance (km) and day of the week to see if the flight arrived late 15 minutes or more. Algorithm learned from training set size of 8 000 and predicted test set size of 2 000. The random forest classifier accuracy was about 67%. From the plot we see that increasing the amount of decision trees does not get better accuracy. It only has a small swing at the fewer decision trees .

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>From the correlation matrix we can see that there seems to be only a little correlation to none on the variables. This said we could not really choose better variables to examine from this data and flights' delays are mostly could not be predicted because of the randomness.
